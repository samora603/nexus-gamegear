# Project Status — GameGear Nexus

> Last updated: CMS seed (2026-10-08)

---

## Current Phase

**Frontend data layer — next**

The static frontend is unchanged and still reads `src/data/*`. The remote database now holds that same content.

---

## Completed

### Static frontend
- [x] Homepage
- [x] Reusable category template for all six category pages

### Remote schema
- [x] Project `pdqwaftiflaaelwzzypp` (`https://pdqwaftiflaaelwzzypp.supabase.co`)
- [x] Migrations `20250901000000` through `20250901000013` applied
- [x] RLS on all 10 application tables
- [x] Buckets `media` (public) and `uploads` (private)

### CMS seed
- [x] Script: `scripts/seed-cms.mjs` (`npm run seed:cms`)
- [x] 38 WebP files in the `media` bucket
- [x] 38 `media_assets` rows, paths `home/<file>.webp` and `categories/<slug>/<file>.webp`
- [x] Tables seeded and re-checked after a second run: site_settings 1, social_links 3, features 3, content_blocks 2, categories 6, category_pills 19, category_collages 6, collage_layers 31, contact_grid_images 1
- [x] Foreign keys resolve; no duplicate storage paths
- [x] Anonymous clients can read published rows and public media URLs
- [x] Anonymous insert/update/delete and storage writes were denied
- [x] Unpublished probe row was not visible to the anon key, then removed

The seed uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` when it is present. That key is not in the repository. A short-lived function `cms-seed-relay` was used for the first two runs and then replaced with a handler that returns HTTP 410. It does not seed anymore.

---

## In Progress

Nothing in the React app.

---

## Remaining

- Read the seeded tables from a data-access layer
- Switch pages off `src/data/*` only after visual parity is checked
- Authentication and admin role assignment
- CMS dashboard
- Admin write tests (not run; no admin user was created)

---

## Not done

- Authentication UI
- Admin dashboard
- Supabase-backed pages

---

## Next Action

Add a read-only data layer that loads the seeded Supabase rows and maps them back to the existing component props, with the current static data kept until the pages are switched on purpose.

---

## Known seed limits

- Overlay text is stored. Its Tailwind position is not, because the text box has no width in the schema.
- The communication primary clip is a bottom-right chamfer. The schema only has `chamfer_bottom_left` and `notch_top_right`, so that clip is stored as `none`.
- The dark overlay skew is not stored. `rotation_deg` is 0.
- Layers positioned with `bottom` and no height use a square-box fallback for `pos_top_pct`. `height_pct` stays null.
- `designFile` and `contactAnchor` are not database columns.
- `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` still describes the earlier empty-project setup.

## Cursor State

Remote content verified on `pdqwaftiflaaelwzzypp`. Frontend remains static.
